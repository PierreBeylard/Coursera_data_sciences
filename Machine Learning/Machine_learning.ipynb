It's more popular than mean absolute error because the focus is geared more towards large errors. This is due to the squared term exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to smaller ones.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **Root mean squared error.** </span> Root mean squared error is the square root of the mean squared error. This is one of the most popular of the evaluation metrics because root mean squared error is interpretable in the same units as the response vector or y units, making it easy to relate its information. \n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **Relative absolute error.** </span> Relative absolute error, also known as residual sum of square, where y bar is a mean value of y, takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total absolute error of the simple predictor.

The first is to visually figure out if the relation is linear or non-linear. **It's best to plot bivariate plots of output variables with each input variable.** Also, you can **calculate the correlation** coefficient between independent and dependent variables, and **if, for all variables, it is 0.7 or higher, there is a linear tendency** and thus, it's not appropriate to fit a non-linear regression. \n",

    "**The second important question is, how should I model my data if it displays non-linear on a scatter plot?**  \n",

Logarithmic loss (also known as Log loss) measures the performance of a classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
