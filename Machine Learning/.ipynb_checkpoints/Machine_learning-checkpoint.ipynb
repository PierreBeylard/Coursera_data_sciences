Generally speaking, it is more complicated to implement as we know little about the data and the expected outcomes. The dataset is **not labeled**\n",

Since there are multiple data points, an error can be determined in multiple ways. \n",

    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **Mean absolute error** </span> Mean absolute error is the mean of the absolute value of the errors. This is the easiest of the metrics to understand, since it's just the average error.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **Mean squared error** </span> Mean squared error is the mean of the squared error. It's more popular than mean absolute error because the focus is geared more towards large errors. This is due to the squared term exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to smaller ones.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **Root mean squared error.** </span> Root mean squared error is the square root of the mean squared error. This is one of the most popular of the evaluation metrics because root mean squared error is interpretable in the same units as the response vector or y units, making it easy to relate its information. \n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **Relative absolute error.** </span> Relative absolute error, also known as residual sum of square, where y bar is a mean value of y, takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total absolute error of the simple predictor. Relative squared error is very similar to relative absolute error but is widely adopted by the data science community, as it is used for calculating R squared.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\"> **R squared.** </span> R squared is not an error per se but is a popular metric for the accuracy of your model. It represents how close the data values are to the fitted regression line. The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. \n",

For example, __you can use scatter plots and then visually checked for linearity._ If the relationship displayed in your scatter plot is not linear, then you need to use non-linear regression\n",
